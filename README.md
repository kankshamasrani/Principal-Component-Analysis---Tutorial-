Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a simple yet powerful technique used for dimensionality reduction. Through it, we can directly decrease the number of feature variables, thereby narrowing down the important features and saving on computations. From a high-level view PCA has three main steps:

(1) Compute the covariance matrix of the data

(2) Compute the eigen values and vectors of this covariance matrix

(3) Use the eigen values and vectors to select only the most important feature vectors and then transform your data onto those vectors for     reduced dimensionality!
